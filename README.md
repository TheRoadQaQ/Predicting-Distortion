### Evaluating and Predicting Distorted Human Body Parts for Generated Images
- 🤗 HF Dataset [`Distorted-5K`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xgklndsgkl/Distorted-5K)

I sincerely apologize, but I was unable to obtain approval to open-source the original internship data used in the paper. The data currently released consists of images generated by open-source models, which carry no risk; this is why I released them in advance. Additionally, the paper has been withdrawn from arXiv. We hope this open-source dataset proves useful to the community.
